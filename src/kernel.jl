# The problem is to minimize
#
#     E(σ) = Σᵢ hᵢ σᵢ + Σ_{i<j} Jᵢⱼ σᵢ σⱼ,     σᵢ = ±1,
#
# with J symmetric and zero on the diagonal. Each binary variable becomes a
# classical unit spin nᵢ = (nˣ, nʸ, nᶻ), started at (1, 0, 0). Step k (layer k
# in the paper) rotates every spin twice:
#
#   1. about ẑ by the angle 2γₖ mᵢ / s, where mᵢ = hᵢ + Σⱼ Jᵢⱼ nⱼᶻ is the
#      effective field spin i feels from the problem (one product of J with a
#      vector per step) and s is the problem's field scale;
#   2. about x̂ by the angle 2βₖ Δᵢ, where Δᵢ > 0 is the driver strength.
#
# These are Eqs. 10–12 of Misra-Spieldenner et al., PRX Quantum 4, 030335
# (2023), with (h, J) → (−h, −J): the paper minimizes −Σᵢ[hᵢ + Σ_{j>i} Jᵢⱼσⱼ]σᵢ,
# we minimize +Σᵢ[...]σᵢ, so the ẑ rotation runs the other way round. The
# rotation sense follows from the precession ∂ₜn = n × B with B = −2∇ₙH: a
# positive effective field mᵢ pushes nᵢᶻ negative, which lowers hᵢσᵢ.
#
# Two things enter the ẑ angle only as a common factor, so they cost one
# scalar per step instead of a rescaled or negated copy of the problem: the
# field scale s, which makes the dynamics independent of the units of the
# objective, and the sense. Maximizing E is minimizing −E, whose field is −mᵢ,
# so a maximization rotates by −2γₖ mᵢ / s.
#
# After the last step, σᵢ = sign(nᵢᶻ). A spin that ends exactly on the
# equator takes the sign that improves the objective in its final field, and
# +1 if that field vanishes too.
#
# Spins are stored as three separate vectors (x, y, z) so the product with J
# reads a contiguous z and the rotations stream over x, y, z.
